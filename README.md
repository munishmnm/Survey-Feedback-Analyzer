# Python Capstone Project – Customer Feedback Analysis

In this project, I built a Customer Feedback Management System using Python.
The program collects, cleans, and analyzes customer feedback to understand service satisfaction levels.

# 🔹 Key Features:

Collected customer feedback and ratings dynamically using user input.

Performed data cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation & space removal).

Managed structured data lists for names, feedback, and ratings.

Demonstrated real-time data entry, storage, and preprocessing techniques.


# 📊 Tools & Libraries Used: Python (Core), Lists, Loops, String Functions
# 🎯 Outcome:
This project helps understand how customer sentiment can be processed and organized for analytics and reporting — an essential step in Data Analytics & Text Processing.
